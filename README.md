# GIT REBASE

Simple exercises to practice git rebase.
This is just a text fragment about Python regular expressions copied from
the official documentation.

You're supposed to rebase your commits of each branch (in alphabetical order) on
top of the current `master` branch and merge them.

The idea is to experiment with the rebase command and to clean up the commit
story.

## 1 Introduction section

Rebase the branch 01_introduction onto master.

 1. Change the commit descriptions and make sure they have a JIRA-like format
 1. Can we make the 2nd paragraph to be added in a single commit
 1. And for the 3rd

## 2 Simple Patterns section

 1. Rebase onto master
 1. Solve possible conflicts and check the text is ok

## 3 Repeating things section

 1. Rebase onto master
 1. Solve conflicts
 1. Make the table to be added in a commit
 1. Add the last commit (finish section)
